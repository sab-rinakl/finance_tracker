# finance_tracker
 A budgeting app for iOS and Andriod built in Flutter. Final project for CSCI 368: Cross-Platform App Developement.

 I have developed a Personal Finance Tracker App that simplifies managing finances for users. The app has three screens: the Overview, Budgeting, and Transactions screens. The Overview provides a quick summary of the userâ€™s financial status,
 showing how much has been spent compared to set budgets. Meanwhile, the Transactions screen allows users to add, view, and categorize their expenses and incomes, offering a detailed look into their financial activities in a list view. On the Budgeting screen, users can set budget limits for different categories, which will reflect on the dashboard, providing real-time financial updates.
